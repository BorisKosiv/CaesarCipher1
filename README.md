# CaesarCipher1
In this project, I realized the ability to encrypt and decrypt text written in English or Ukrainian languages using Caesar Cipher.
   The Caesar Cipher, used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC, is a substitution cipher that shifts letters in a message to make it unreadable if intercepted. To decrypt, the receiver reverses the shift. Arab mathematician Al-Kindy broke the Caesar Cipher using frequency analysis, which exploits patterns in letter frequencies.
The project has been made in a simple way with a minimum of coding. I used a few Classes which implement Interfaces.
All the main requirements of the task for the project have been implemented, except next items :
1.	The menu CLI and control of arguments entered by the user;
2.	Brute_force realized based on frequency analysis for the English alphabet only;
3.	Additional task to the project;

 I will make it as soon as possible.
